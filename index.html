        <p class="book-description">“The Chronicles of Sunflower Grove: Sun Bean Chuckles” is a collection of short stories that are set in the coffee shop Sun Bean Coffee, in the town of Sunflower Grove. The little robot barista, Brewster, finds himself in comical situations while trying to blend in with the human world. In “Made with Love” he sets out on an adventure, discovering what love is. So he can infuse his coffee with love. In “Yawning Frenzy” he finds himself in a hilarious situation of the customers having contagious yawns. In “Max & Jasper: A Latte of Laughter,” the coffee shop is left in stitches as the boys find a coffee joke book and read aloud from it.
